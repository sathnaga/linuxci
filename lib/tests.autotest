ltp                 : This test exercises FS, IO, Memory, IPC, Scheduler, syscalls etc.
fio                 : I/O tool meant to be used both for benchmark and stress/hardware.
stress              : Stress tool to exercise kernel subsystems CPU, MMU, IO
dbench              : Produces filesystem load, throughput rates for performance analysis.
iozone              : benchmark tests for filesystem stres and I/O performance.
disktest            : Storage stress, check data corruption in disk and disk controller.
fsfuzzer            : fsfuzz will inject random errors into the files systems.
sleeptest           : This test simply sleeps for 1 second by default.
aiostress           : Sequential workload. test stresses the aio interface not the disk.
asynctest           : test demonstrates how the asynchronous local job api works.
bonnie              : sequential and a random IO workload, profile measurements throughput, %CPU rand seeks per second.
ebizzy              : Simulates web server workloads, highly threaded, frequent in-memory alloc/dealloc and will max out the CPU.
fs_mark             : Detect barrier issues in file systems.
fsstress            : Simulates transactional DB workloads, It writes about 24MB/s but has many small writes a second.
hackbench           : Performance measure, overhead and scalability of the Linux scheduler.
interbench          : Benchmarking tool for CPU, I/O and scheduler
kernbench           : Runs a kernel compile and measures the performance
lvsetup             : LVM tests
